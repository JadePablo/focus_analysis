# focus_analysis

This repository contains a script for recording your face, csv files of the data I got while running the script and a python notebook analysing the data.

Details of the face-recording script can be found in the file: 'main.py'

Analysis can be found in the notebook: 'focus_analysis.pynb'
  - skip to the end of the notebook for visualisations and findings.

Face-recording done with opencv.

Analysis done with pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.
